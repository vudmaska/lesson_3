Habit 1: I agree that physical and mental health are important.
Habit 2: Frequent updates can help us with the development, especially if we use some kind of "Feedback loop". We will
         have frequent updates and we can find bugs/errors faster.
Habit 3: I cannot agree more, keeping things simple will make it easier for everyone.
Habit 4: I agree, there is not much to say about it. We need some time when we can concentrate and think about the issue
         we are working on without any interruptions.
Habit 5: We always have to learn new things.
Habit 6: I dont have a problem with working on a task alone, but I much rather collaborate with someone and/or
         work in pairs. Everyone thinks differently and can have a different solution or point of view on a problem.
         Also working on a task is more interesting that way.
Habit 7: This one is kinda related to the 6th habit. So as I have said before, I dont mind working on a task alone, I
         am aware that I would have to work on a stuff alone sometimes or do some self-learning in my free time.
